Pic to emoji

"Vibe coded" in about an hour with Cursor. Only took 1 prompt to get the initial app working, and then a little while to fix up some details and make some small manual stylistic edits. Overall, a fun project! 

32x32 images are too big for a post on X / Facebook, try converting an image that is 10x10 if you want something you can share on X.
